hello all my name is krishak and welcome to my YouTube channel so guys just a couple of days back you know I had taken a live session on resume reviews and just within a time span of 1 hour 30 minutes I was able to review 200 plus rums some of the resums were able to definitely impress me and uh some resums and most of the resumes more than probably 50 to 60 percentage of the resumes were following the same mistake okay so in this particular video Im going to talk about some important things that you should definitely write in your resume you know and what all things you should definitely focus at nowadays many companies are specifically using ATS system to probably scan and select the resume if you also want to make sure that your resume always clears at least that at ATS round you know so what all things you really need to focus on now this particular video is really important because trust me because resume is something you know it is just like a tool that talks about yourself to the outside world you know nobody knows about you right so that is the reason we specifically create resume in this job industry because at least you should get an idea like what I or what Im actually doing you know so in this specific video lets go ahead and discuss I created somewhere around five to six points you really to focus on that and what all things you really need to write over there I will be talking about it okay so let me go ahead and share my screen so here uh Ive written Five Points uh so let me go ahead and write my sixth point over here okay so this is my sixth point which Im writing in another color because this is really important goal and outcome okay now first of all definitely uh when we talk about ads system ATS system right and if you know that Ive also created multiple projects of creating this ATS system with the help of generative AI models like llm models and all now in many companies you know whenever a specific hiring is actually done you know so they basically use some kind of ATS system so that the resume gets automatically picked based on the job role okay so first of all whenever you specifically look at the job role you have to probably see what kind of roles in responsibilities they are actually asking for you know so job role you need to focus on the roles and responsibilities so this is the most important point right lets say I have a requirement for NLP Engineers I have a requirement for computer vision developer please go ahead and see the jobs and roles and responsibilities okay then when I talk about skill sets you really need to write the skill sets that you are good at okay this is really important whatever whatever skill sets you have specifically worked you have experience in that lets say I have experience in working machine learning algorithms generative AI models llm models I build end to endend projects I am very good at databases so Ill just go and write those specific skill sets Im good at Python programming language I am good at working with fast API lets say so those are the skill sets and you have to make sure that you put those kind of specific skill sets Okay that is really important many people what they do is that they write skill set separately they write tools that they specifically use separately like IDs vs code you know all those specific things they actually write so skill sets are really important I I I dont care like what kind of template you specifically follow okay template you specifically follow its okay you can follow any resume template as per your wish okay but the first and foremost important thing is that about your skill sets this skill sets will definitely help you to clear from the ATS you know ATS system so you need to write the necessary skill sets which you specifically know now that does not mean that hey Im going to go ahead and write 100 skill sets over here no right what are the important skill sets that actually matters to you you have to write lets say that you write 100 hundreds and hundreds of skill sets you may clear the ATS system but after that it become very difficult because youve written so many things over there because the same resume will go over there right so skill sets is really important be very precise with respect to the technologies that you are writing lets say Im very interested in computer vision Ill write NLP Ill write generative AI Ill write data science machine learning because I have worked on all these things and whichever probably interviews I go Im very much comfortable with that you can probably go ahead and ask me right and I would be able to answer okay so that is the first important thing with respect to the skill sets now coming to the second thing which I saw that people lacked okay the roles and responsibilities okay many people people like see guys data science now its like in a level many Advanced things are actually coming in this world now still in the roles and responsibilities will write hey I did feature engineering I probably cleaned the data I annotated the data it will not work okay you have to probably talk about the roles and responsibilities that you have specifically done in the project that is fine okay Additionally you have to talk with respect to the complete project implementation okay in the complete project implementation what all things you specifically did which all modules you actually developed you know how you work as a team how what was your specific role in team that all things needs to be included right and that is what I have actually seen see 90 of the people have written good things about the roles and responsibilities theyre able to clarify those things like what main things they actually did in that specific project or in a company if there if it was their personal project what all things they actually did I liked about that you know but still in the 10 remaining 10 percentage of the resume what I saw is that they have just written one liner okay I worked as a data scientist data with three plus years of experience I did data processing and done almost like two to three sentences and it is very much clear with respect to the roles and responsibility so see if I am a recruiter I Ive recently recruited some freshes what I did did is that I just saw the resume I told them to build something you know because written those kind of skill sets over there they have written those kind of roles and responsibilities over there and just I gave them a task and they were able to complete it right so how I am coming to that particular conclusion because they had written that information in the roles and responsibilities okay now coming to the third point which many people lacked is with respect to the project explanation when I talk about project explanation Im not talking about module explanation Im talking about the end to endend project explanation okay end to endend project explanation so you may talk about what clouds you specifically use and I would suggest guys again whether it is a Capstone project whether is a time pass project always do it as end to end and the be and the and and and the saddest thing was that as soon as I probably just see the project name right I just see the project name then I know that okay its a very basic simple project there are two resumes that I actually seen one the person has done some kind of Capt on Project he did end to end but just by seeing those information that he had written in that right I felt that it is a very basic project the same project was written by someone else in his resume in a better way okay now when they write in a better way they have said that okay they have used ec2 instance to do the deployment theyve used GitHub actions to probably complete the end to end project over here for the automation right the first person had missed this kind of information right so the project is same but this kind of information actually makes your project explanation looks better looks good when compared to the previous one because I if I probably see the person has used mlops tools they used about MLF flow DBC all those information are specifically written this person okay he implemented this he did this uh and he had just explained in that terms and the other person had explained completely end to end what exactly he did what all mops tools he used what all deployment techniques he used everything was explained in a better way the project was same so which one did you do you like the other one right where you have more and more explanation similarly that happens with the technical interviewer right whenever technical interviewer sees all those information he will definitely ask questions from them right highlighting the points which are important which are not important that is also really important so when you are also explaining the project make sure that the technical interviewer will like those kind of terms if someone has written hey a C2 instance if someone has written about Dockers someone has written about kubernetes and they have highlighted that point then definitely I will like it so the conclusion of this specific point is that try to explain your project in a better way make sure to talk about all the things that you have used and always do the highlighting of those words as a technical recruiter I would like to see mlops I would like to probably see about Dockers Id like to probably talk about U deployment GitHub action how we probably automated the entire project with respect to the deployment and obviously the kind of modules that he have actually developed so all those information needs to be specified in the project explanation and again that day I did not see much information about the project explanation also okay so that is really important these are some of the key points Ive already taken so many different live sessions in resums and all so I think uh you can just go and check Krishna resumes and you will be able to see i selected some of the amazing resumes and already it is there in my YouTube channel now the next thing that many people were missing were the portfolio link they were putting the LinkedIn they were putting the GitHub you know whenever I talk about portfolio it was GitHub LinkedIn all these information whatever link you put right it needs to be completely updated okay completely updated and lets say youre ping GitHub link right your contribution should be there recent contribution you know many people GitHub link I opened that was updated one year back 6 months back you know so dont do that whatever information youre writing with respect to your portfolio link make sure you have that completely updated with all the information with all the projects and in all your personal projects also please make sure that you update the readme file this is also really important without this it will not look good so whatever portfolio link you are uploading please make sure that it is basically updated okay it is important this is just a straight talk to talk about lot of mistakes that you actually do because at the end of the day sir Im not getting a call why because these are the specific mistakes that youre specifically doing some other people are able to get call some other freshers are able to get call why you not able to get call because youre lacking in this specific thing okay coming to the next one is with respect to the open source contribution open source contribution if you are doing anything if you are running a community that would also add a very good point okay let me talk about my previous company Panasonic okay so Panasonic in Panasonic I went for the interview I told them I already have a YouTube channel I contributing Im teaching people along with that I Im also writing a book as soon as they saw heard about writing a book the really really really happy to hire me they spoke about the book what topics have I actually covering in the book and all right so open source contribution is valued in most of the companies and there are many many companies who are actually Building open source things right so that would definitely be helpful here you are focusing on community building here you are focusing on multiple things so this is really really important with respect to the open source contribution now one amazing thing that I saw in more than 95 of the resume is about the goals and outcome this was really amazing the goals and outcome was updated in almost every resume that is the best thing because in previous sessions of my resume have stressed on this specific point about goals and resume goals and outcome what are the goals and outcome like what were you able to achieve achievement from the project okay achievement from the project right achievement from the this was really important like what you are able to achieve and many many people were able to write this what are the goals that they were able to achieve right because of this 90 of the things got automated because of this the model performance improved you know so this kind of goals and outcome what they really want to achieve right so overall this were the major points that I was looking for in most of the resumes and they were around hardly 10 of the resumes are satisfying with respect to all these points but you have all these things updated trust me it will be a very amazing thing definitely a game changer and all right now many people will specifically ask for templates and all guys chat dput is there Google gini is there just go and ask okay for roles and responsibilities I want to include this this this please try to explain me in this way Ive done this particular project how to write this particular words project explanation I have developed this this this this modules you know tell me how should I probably go ahead and develop for my how should I write it for my resume just go and search you will be able to get all the information over there right so this is really important and these are the major points that I have seen so I hope you like this particular video uh yes in this upcoming weekend again we will do those kind of live resume review session and I hope youll enjoy that so well try to do that in the weekend on Sunday but these are the main key points that you should really focus on before we proceed okay so yes this was it for my side I will see you in the next video thank you take care
